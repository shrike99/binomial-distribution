# binomial-distribution

A JavaScript project that helps users compute binomial probability distributions. The project includes functions for factorial calculations, combination calculations, and functions to calculate the probability of a specific outcome, or the probability of a range of outcomes, given certain parameters. The project also includes a D3.js implementation to visualize the probability distribution. The project can be run in a browser and requires user input for the number of trials, number of successful outcomes, and probability of success for each trial.
